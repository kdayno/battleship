# Battleship Game Project

## What is the project?

The purpose of the battleship game project is to re-create the classic board game, Battleship. It will be accessible via the command line interface. The project is going to be built with Python using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It will have one game mode: Player vs. Bot. The Player and Bot will both place 3 ships each. Then, they will take turns targeting each other's board to sink their opponent's ships. The game is over when either player's ships have all been destoryed.

## What is the MVP?

The minimum viable product is the battleship game that renders on the command line and allows a Player to play a game of battleship against a Bot. 

## What are the nice to haves?

- Validate player inputs
- Create graphical user interface via a webpage

## When will the project be complete?

The project will be complete once all the MVP features have been implemented using object oriented programming.
